[Milestone 1](#milestone-1) • [Milestone 2](#milestone-2) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (7th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.

[PDF is an acceptable submission format](https://edstem.org/eu/courses/94/discussion/29290?comment=52044), thus our milestone \#1 is here: https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/project-2023-high-dimensional-explorers/blob/master/milestone1.pdf.

## Milestone 2 (7th May, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

Our second milestone can be found here: https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/project-2023-high-dimensional-explorers/blob/master/milestone2.pdf.
The building blocks of the visualization can be found in the folder `m2_building_blocks`.

It uses Python and the bokeh library, you can find the needed libraries in the file `requirements.txt`. 
To run the main prototype you can use the following command:
```shell
$ bokeh serve bokeh_slider_example.py
```
which will create a bokeh server and run simulations on the fly.

The other two components don't need to have a backend server running so you can get the corresponding web pages by running.

```shell
$ python grid.py
```
and 

```shell
$ python model_description.py
```



## Milestone 3 (4th June, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**


## Late policy

- < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
- < 48h: 70% of the grade for the milestone
